As with any product being built by a team, there are various areas where standards, conventions, and other guidelines can play a role in helping to ensure that the resulting product presents to developers and customers as a unified whole rather than as a loose collection of parts worked on by a variety of individuals each with their own styles and ways of working.

The following list of standards, conventions, and guidelines cover a wide range of aspects of the Eclipse project:
* [[Naming Conventions]] - How to name things like packages, classes, and methods
* [[Coding Conventions]] - How to make Java code readable
* [[Javadoc]] - How to write documentation comments, especially for API
* [[User Interface Guidelines]] - How to achieve user interface consistency
* [[Version Numbering]] - How to evolve plug-in version numbers
