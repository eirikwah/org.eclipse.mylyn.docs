Sun has established coding standards that are generally considered reasonable, as evidenced by their widespread adoption by other Java-based development efforts (e.g., [http://jakarta.apache.org/ the Apache Jakarta project]). One of the goals is to make the Eclipse Platform blend in with the Java 2 platform. This goal is furthered by our following suit.

[http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/index.html Sun's Code Conventions for the Java Programming Language] covers filenames, file organization, indentation, comments, declarations, statements, white space, naming conventions, and programming practices. All code written for the Eclipse Platform should follow these conventions except as noted below. We deviate only in places where our needs differ from Sun's; when we do deviate, we explain why. (The section numbers shown below are Sun's.)


* Section 3.1.1 Beginning Comments
The Eclipse project has specific guidelines for copyright notices to appear at the beginning of source files. See the [http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/eclipse-charter.html Eclipse Project Charter] for details.

* Section 9 Naming Conventions
The Eclipse project has more specific naming conventions. See Eclipse Project [[Naming Conventions]] for details.
