h1. Generate EPUB using Ant

p. Using the **epub** Ant task one can assemble an EPUB during continuous building or from within Eclipse. The example below shows a complete minimum Ant script.

bc. 
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project name="EPUB Simple Example" default="epub">
  <target name="epub">
    <epub file="My Book.epub">
      <title>My Book</title>
      <subject>My Book's subject</subject>
      <item file="my_chapter.xhtml" />
    </epub>
  </target>
</project>

p. In this example only some of the required fields have been specified, the rest will be automatically added. See the comprehensive description of the "epub":epub-ant-task.html Ant task for details. A more complete example is found in the "examples":examples.html chapter.

p. Note that in order for the script to execute the epub task must be in the classpath. If you execute the script from within Eclipse simply make sure that the runtime environment of the workspace is used.
