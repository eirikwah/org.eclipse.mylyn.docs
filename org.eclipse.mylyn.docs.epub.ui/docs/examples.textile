h2. Adding a cover

p. Correctly adding a cover to a publication can be a bit awkward as different reading systems expect different input. So there is a shortcut:

bc.. 
<cover image="cover.jpg" title="My Title"/> 

p. Simply point to the file in question and this EPUB tooling will take care of the rest. There is of course another, more laborious way: 

# Add a cover image to the publication
# Add a HTML file using the image
# Reference the HTML file
# Add a meta element pointing to the image

p. Assuming the cover image is ready we will add it using the **item** element as this:

bc.. 
<item file="images/cover.jpg" id="cover-image" type="image/jpg" spine="false" />

p. Next we add a XHTML file (named __cover.html__) to the publication. This will be used by some reading systems.

bc.. 
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" standalone="no"?>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <head>
    <title>Cover Page</title>
    <style type="text/css"> img { max-width: 100%; }</style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="cover-image">
      <img src="cover.jpg" alt="Building EPUBs"/>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>

p. Then some more Ant code:

bc.. 
<item file="cover.xhtml"/>
<reference href="cover.xhtml" type="cover" title="Cover Page" />
<meta name="cover" content="cover-image"/>

p. This method will produce a cover page that will work with all the tested reading systems; including Calibre, iBooks, Adobe Digital Editions and Kindle (after converting to MOBI using Calibre).

p. The end result can be something like the illustration above.
