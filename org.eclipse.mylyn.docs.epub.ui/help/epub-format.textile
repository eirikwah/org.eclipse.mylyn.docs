h1. The EPUB file format

p. The __EPUB file format__ is basically a ZIP-file with a defined set of contents. The first file in the container is a file by the ASCII name of "mimetype" which holds the MIME type for the ZIP container. This file must be treated a bit special as the contents are defined and the file must not be compressed, nor encrypted and there must be no extra fields in it's ZIP header. 

p. The EPUB also have a META-INF folder that contains a file named __container.xml__. This declares the format of the publication and points to the main entry: __content.opf__. If there is a table of contents (__toc.ncx__) the main entry will point to it.
